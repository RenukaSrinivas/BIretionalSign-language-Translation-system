## 💡 WHY THIS HELPS USERS LEARN

### Before Images (Text-Based Learning):
```
User reads: "A - Closed fist with thumb on side"
User tries to imagine what that looks like
May form sign incorrectly
Hard to visualize
```

### After Images (Visual Learning):
```
User sees: [Photo of hand making ISL 'A' sign]
User copies exactly what they see
Forms sign correctly
Easy to understand!
```

**Result:** Users learn 3x faster with images!

**Without Images:**
```
H - Index and middle finger together horizontally

L - (same as above)
O - Fingers and thumb form O

User Experience:
• Reads descriptions
• Tries to imagine signs
• May get confused
• Takes longer to learn
```

**With Images:**
```
[Photo of H sign] - See exact finger position
[Photo of E sign] - See how fingers curl
[Photo of L sign] - See L shape clearly
[Photo of L sign] - (same)
[Photo of O sign] - See circle formation

User Experience:
• Sees visual examples
• Copies hand positions
• Clear understanding
