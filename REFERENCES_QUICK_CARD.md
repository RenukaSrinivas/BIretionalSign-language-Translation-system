## 📝 READY-TO-USE SENTENCES

### Introduction:
```
Indian Sign Language (ISL) is used by over 2.7 million 
individuals in India [4]. Recent advances in deep learning [6] 
and real-time hand tracking [1] have enabled development of 
automated sign language recognition systems.
```

### Technology:
```
The system is built using the MERN stack architecture [17], 
combining MongoDB [9], Express.js, React.js [7], and Node.js [8]. 
Real-time hand gesture detection is performed using 
MediaPipe Hands [1].
```

### Machine Learning:
```
MediaPipe [1] extracts 21 hand landmarks, which are processed 
using TensorFlow [2] for gesture classification. This approach 
follows modern deep learning principles [6].
```

## ✍️ SAMPLE PARAGRAPH WITH CITATIONS

```
The proposed Indian Sign Language translation system 
leverages state-of-the-art computer vision and deep 
learning techniques. The system architecture implements 
MediaPipe Hands [1] for real-time hand landmark detection, 
extracting 21 keypoints per hand with high accuracy. 
Following the guidelines established by the Indian Sign 
Language Research and Training Centre [4], we implemented 
recognition for 36 ISL gestures including the complete 
alphabet and numbers 0-9. The application is built using 
modern web technologies including React.js [7] for the 
frontend, Node.js [8] for the backend, and MongoDB [9] 
for data persistence. Machine learning models were 
implemented using TensorFlow [2], applying deep learning 
principles [6] to achieve accurate gesture classification. 
Our approach aligns with recent advances in sign language 
recognition research [11], [12], [13], demonstrating the 
potential of AI-powered assistive technologies for the 
deaf and hard-of-hearing community.
